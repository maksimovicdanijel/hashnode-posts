# Derived state in React

### What is a derived state?

A derived state is a value that is computed from a state value. For example:

```typescript
import React from 'react'

const Example: React.FC = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  const doubleCounter = counter * 2  

  return <p>{doubleCounter}</p>
}
```

This might be a trivial example, but I've seen it used in a totally wrong way many times in React codebases.

```typescript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

const Example: React.FC = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)
  const [doubleCounter, setDoubleCounter] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    setDoubleCounter(counter * 2)
  }, [counter])

  return <p>{doubleCounter}</p>
}
```

Why is this wrong? Because we are forcing React to update twice without any reason. The first time it updates when the `counter` changes, and the second time when the `doubleCounter` changes.

Now, how many times have you seen data fetched from the API, and then in `useEffect` it gets transformed and stored in a state? Transformed data shouldn't be stored in a state variable, it should be stored in a regular JS variable to avoid unnecessary reconciliations like in the first code example.
